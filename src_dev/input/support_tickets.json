I'd hate to have to cross-reference each line item to the monthly Validation (where it is listed each month - see, for example - Column X in this sheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mJVo7Ko3GMggaDVyuDYEVp5Jb05AN9csT5NDlaWLhPs/edit?usp=sharing) to retroactively populate that field - \n\nIs there a way to re-run the Lease Award data, and fill in that empty field - without a massive, scary effort?\n\nThanks for looking into it!\n\nAndrea","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"06/03/2024 Chantelle Lim - B-C Ticket can be closed.

What would help them is to be able to more easily cross-reference our data with theirs - RWA # and Org Code isn't enough - so they asked if it was possible to pull in from RETA/BI 3 new elements:  Award #, Project # and Period of Performance.  If we could suck those in, and let that travel with the data set from Validation through Action Items - then the Acquisition community could make the best use of the feedback.  Is that possible?\n\nFor the request for a change to the Action Items sheet and the Workbook - can we add in the Org Code/Team Name - That data is in the Validation sheet already, and we display it in the Dashboard, but for some reason, we haven't been displaying it in the Workbook or on the Action Items.  The Regions really like that for their analysis purposes.\n\nI'm not sure which \"shop\" is better suited to address which one of these asks, but I figured if I explained what I was looking for- you guys could advise me as to the right way to make the formal request for assistance.\n\nThanks for taking a look and for your advice/help!","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"06/03/2024 Chantelle Lim - B-C Ticket can be closed.

Aaron went in the same day to update the Items to Process sheet to switch that contract from \"Backfill\" to \"Planned\".\n\nIt looks like the bot still sent the letter, even though it was after the 365 Letter Date. My understanding of how the bot is supposed to run is that it looks at the list and will send the letter out for any planned audit 2 days before this 365-Letter-Date. Do you know if it's also programmed to send out letters if one flips from backfill to planned after that date? We want to make sure we're advising the workforce accordingly, because we told them if they get notified of a backfill audit selection after that 365-letter date, they have to manually send out this letter.

The GSA travel card policy, OAS 5740.1 CHGE 2 Government Travel Charge Card Program, requires employees to pay any undisputed travel card balance by the due date on the billing statement. Pay the delinquent balance in full to resolve this matter. \n\nTravelers must take the following steps to avoid your account becoming delinquent in the future: \n\nSubmit ConcurGov vouchers within five business days after travel is completed; Use the split-disbursement feature to send funds to the travel card bank for expenses incurred during official travel;For long-term temporary duty (TDY) travel (more than 30 days), submit an interim travel voucher for payment every 30 calendar days to maintain your travel card account in a current status.If you have questions regarding your delinquent balance, please contact gsa-oas-travelteam@gsa.gov or visit the travel card Insite page.\n\nFollow these instructions to register your travel card account online with US Bank.\n\nHere is the email the supervisor receive for the Travel card Delinquency from the BOT attached to the individual spreadsheets:\n\nGreetings,\n\nThe attached listing provides the names of those employee(s) within your organization who were delinquent on their US BANK Government Travel Card account EFFECTIVE January 2023.

Delinquent payment of travel card accounts results in loss of rebate to the agency. When using Concur Government Edition (ConcurGov) to submit their travel voucher, travelers are to use the split disbursement function to send payments directly to the bank (payment method \"“IBA”\") for items charged to their Government Travel Card.Action Needed: Please provide a response for Columns O & P to indicate the action taken by selecting an option from the drop down list of the google spreadsheet. Please complete by COB, 02/09/2023.

I have experimented with using smaller selection sets that exclude some of the previously selected categories. This has worked well as it simplifies the results exported to EcoDomus from Revit, and reduces time in processing.\n\nHow difficult would it be to reduce the original sets with new, smaller sets in the BOT?\n\nTo be clear, we can continue as currently set up. There are no errors produced with the larger sets. But, I would definitely consider scheduling a reduction of the sets during a normal, incremental updated release in the future if editing the sets is inconvenient at this time. But if it's not a big deal, I would like to provide you with a revised Selection Set matrix to replace the original one.\n\nI look forward to your reply\nThanks and best regards.\n\nDavid Pagan","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"CLim - made changes to the sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQK0xMLTVRfERSzaBcMuImyNf5HzJ0CEg3pk_XiU4Co/edit#gid=1843820631","status":"Closed","open_date":"6/7/2023 14:50:00","closed_date":"6/21/2023","bug_id":"","enh_id":"","subidea_id":"IDEA-22022","project_folder_id":"1kNEJ3GBX_gGeeN5Ogr56YaWwKdk4rvTW","office_id":"OFF-057","sso":"PBS","dept_code":"PC"},{"ID":"TIC-230235","project_id":"RPA-21087","submitter":"steve.kinsella@gsa.gov","category":"Process change - additional functionality needed","description":"looking for added logs to captured OMS timeout ('appl failed to respond') error","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"Verbose logging created logs which were too large.

I would like to collaborate with you to build on the work that you've already done in creating an API that talks to the Qualtrics Survey tool so that we can further enhance the PBS Project Pulse Survey program.  Our goal is to bring automation to the current manual process of providing the Regions with regular survey Response Status updates.  With help from the BOT, we hope to create not just a weekly snapshot (which quickly goes out of date, and lags behind reality), but a continuously updated (nearly live) view of customer engagement in our survey - this is very important to our program, as Response Rate is a FY24 performance metric, so securing customer participation is high priority.\n\nIn a nutshell - there are 2 parts: 1) I'll need the BOT to go to Qualtrics (which it already does - for uploading mailing lists, and downloading responses) and fetch the monthly distribution reports for each of the 6 survey types that are available in Qualtrics.  Ideally, the BOT would go in every night, and pull down 6 fresh CSV files that capture the day's updates, and drop selected fields in a Google worksheet  2) Our PT team (Rolo Sierra) has already built out the worksheet with the scripting to flesh out the downloaded data from Qualtrics and augment it with additional project details our Regions need to help us track and follow up on survey participation.\n\n","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"09/24/2024 Chantelle Lim - B-C \nWork completed.

As instructed, I will email an attachment with images describing this request.  Please contact me if you have any questions.\nThanks, Ola @ Supply Operations\n\n-----\nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #2:  Submitter POC Info added to the Justification Box\n-- SITUATION:: The NCAL-Bot transactions processed thru the NCAL eTool are assigned to the “NCAL BOT”.  In order to track who made the original request, the “Submitter” must manually add their POC Info into the Justification Box. (see image)\n-- REQUEST:: The Submitter info should be auto-populated into the bottom of the Justification box when the data is loaded into the NCAL eTool.\n \n \nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #3: Remove “PRICE” requirement for Shelf Life (SL) changes\n-- SITUATION::  When the Submitter sends a request for a Shelf Life (SL) update in the NCAL Bot Dashboard, a Price is REQUIRED.  This results in an error message in the NCAL eTool because the Price does not automatically change with a SHELF LIFE update. (see image)\n--REQUEST 3.A::  <<Page 1>> In the “Action” selection, separate / remove Shelf Life (SL) from the UI/QE.  Create a new “Action” selection that is just for Shelf Life (SL) only.\n--REQUEST 3.B.1::  <<Page 2>> Update “Current Selection” to read:: Characteristic Updates | Ch Mgmt (ZSG) | SL \n--REQUEST 3.B.2::  <<Page 2>> Include NSN, Commodity Center, Justification, and Shelf Life (SL) as a REQUIRED fields.  \n \n \n \nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #4:  Add additional columns  to the “Bulk” Price Update\n-- SITUATION:: Based on the current NCAL Bot design, the REVIEWER still has to submit a transaction for ACC and MOP data updates. (see image)\n-- REQUEST 4.A:: <<Page 1>> In the Instructions, update the CSV Template Example.  Add to Columns: ACC and MOP.  \n-- REQUEST 4.B:: <<Page 2>> Create a new “Change Type” selection for Price / PN / ACC / MOP only. Since “Bulk” Price Updates split into two transactions in the NCAL eTool,  ACC and MOP are loaded into the NCAL Bot with the PRICE update transaction. \n-- REQUEST 4.C:: <<Page 2>> Create a new “Change Type” selection for Price / ACC / MOP only. Since “Bulk” Price Updates split into two transactions in the NCAL eTool,  ACC and MOP are loaded into the NCAL Bot with the PRICE update transaction.\n \n \n \nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #5:  \n-- SITUATION:: Those with Administrator access can only assign Reviewers one-at-a-time.  There is a computer processing wait-time for each Reviewer assignment.  Yesterday, there were over 15 transactions all assigned to the same Reviewer.  (Yes, this is common based on workload alignments.)  The Administrator spent more time waiting than assigning.  “Multiple Reviewer Selection” would also improve efficiency with the Reviewer assignments of Bulk Price Updates. (see image)\n-- REQUEST 5:: <<NCAL Dashboard>> When the STATUS is “Awaiting Reviewer Selection”, Those with Administrator access wants to be able to assign multiple rows to the same Reviewer .\n \n","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"12/03/2024 Chantelle Lim - B-C ENH-25001 Jae will contact process owner next week to scope enhancement request","status":"Closed","open_date":"9/17/2024 15:53:01","closed_date":"1/14/2025","bug_id":"","enh_id":"","subidea_id":"IDEA-23119","project_folder_id":"1mmNyHZmM2noYU1V9N0R__80rFfJve8ae","office_id":"OFF-007","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QS"},{"ID":"TIC-240544","project_id":"RPA-22006","submitter":"john.willett@gsa.gov","category":"Completes, but does not produce desired outcome","description":"Can you provide the metadata associated with the pull of O2407-097-047-034255 from Ginvoicing?

An email notification containing a link to the IOA Bot outputs (documents organized in a Google Drive folder). This modernization effort is similar to the Truman bot modernization effort, e.g. getting files off a shared network drive and into cloud drive and emailing the output folder to the requestor.\n2. Modify the variance report format output to be more reader friendly (landscape vs portrait format)\n3.

This may be an enhancement to SRC-25004 if the changes are made to the Qualtrics survey. Estimating 40 - 100 dev hrs depending on how interactive the group wants the app to be. If most of the changes occur in Qualtrics then it will be closer to 40.","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"12/17/2024 Created ENH-25011: FAS QC Market Research Tool (Applet).

Below is a list of improvements, each including a brief summary of the manual actions or issues discussed by the SME, a description of the improvement as it pertains to the current RPA, and the estimated benefits associated with the improvement:\n\n     1.) New ESPC Process - The ESPC accountant adds the new contract Title# to the bot’s master configuration file.\n- Enhancement Explanation: This improvement involves automatically updating the Config File for the current RPA when new ESPC Assets are received. From initial analysis, this improvement appears to be of low complexity.\n- Time Savings: 12 Hours FTE Time Savings - [(2 x 30 Min) x 12 = 12 hrs/year] - On average, this process takes about 30 minutes to complete for each new ESPC contract. It is estimated that two new ESPC contracts are received each month.\n- Additional Benefits: Error Proofing, Improved Cycle Time, Improved Lead Time.\n     2.) New ESPC Process - The ESPC accountant adds the Title#, Region#, Project#, and Building# of the new ESPC contract to the ESPC_Master_File.\n- Enhancement Explanation: This improvement involves automatically updating the ESPC_Master_File for the current RPA when new ESPC Assets are received. From initial analysis, this improvement appears to be of low complexity.\n- Time Savings: 12 Hours FTE Time Savings - [(2 x 30 Min) x 12 = 12 hrs/year] - On average, this process takes about 30 minutes to complete for each new ESPC contract. It is estimated that two new ESPC contracts are received each month.\n- Additional Benefits: Error Proofing, Improved Cycle Time, Improved Lead Time.\n     3.) New ESPC Process - The ESPC accountant calculates the distribution percentage for the CR and adds it to the ESPC Distribution file.\n- Enhancement Explanation: This improvement involves having the RPA calculate the distributions for the CR, and subsequently, having the RPA add them to the ESPC Distribution File. From initial analysis, this improvement seems to be of medium complexity. The team encounters three separate instances: 1) They receive all required documentation while creating the asset, 2) They are creating an asset but have not received the amortization schedules for it, or 3) A contract is received in phases. As these contracts progress into future phases, their distribution files are combined. For the second instance, when the bot cannot find the amortization schedule for the related asset, we’ve discussed creating a second email workflow to allow the amortization schedule to be sent once it’s received from the client, updating the distribution percentages. For the third instance, logic will need to be implemented to recognize multi-phase assets and correctly combine their distribution files as they progress.\n- Time Savings: 48 Hours FTE Time Savings - [(2 x 120 Min) x 12 = 48 hrs/year] - On average, this process takes about two hours to complete for each new ESPC contract. It is estimated that two new ESPC contracts are received each month.\n- Additional Benefits: Error Proofing, Improved Cycle Time, Improved Lead Time.\n     4.) Yearly ESPC Process - The bot failed to start because the password had expired and was not updated before the run.\n- Enhancement Explanation: This improvement involves altering the existing RPA to check for password expiration notifications. When these notifications are encountered, we would like the RPA to notify the custodian that certain passwords are about to expire, and the bot will not function correctly without updating the passwords. From initial analysis, this improvement seems to be of low to medium complexity.\n- Time Savings: N/A\n- Additional Benefits: Error Proofing, Improved Cycle Time.\n     5.) Yearly ESPC Process - The title contained an invoice and a payment on different dates. The bot was unable to process the transactions if they were not within the same period.\n- Enhancement Explanation: This improvement involves modifying the current RPA to identify V7 payment documents, triggering the generation of the CR form in Pegasys. From initial analysis, this improvement appears to be of medium to high complexity, with some additional scoping required.\n- Time Savings: 120 Hours FTE Time Savings - [(4 x 150 Min) x 12 = 120 hrs/year] - On average, this process takes about two and a half hours to complete. It is estimated that the accountant is currently running this process four times a month.\n- Additional Benefits: Error Proofing, Improved Cycle Time.\n     If all these improvements were successfully implemented, we estimate an annual time savings of 198 hours. Additionally, these enhancements would increase process efficiency through error-proofing, improved lead time, and enhanced cycle time.","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"","status":"New","open_date":"2/5/2025 16:42:20","closed_date":"","bug_id":"","enh_id":"","subidea_id":"IDEA-21117","project_folder_id":"16vP60zaZcvd2UwfMHQqIFDsVXYmKBT2h","office_id":"OFF-024","sso":"OCFO","dept_code":"BG"},{"ID":"TIC-250200","project_id":"RPA-21118","submitter":"roger.beatty@gsa.gov","category":"Automation won't start","description":"Good Morning, the 12:30 bot ran fine, however the 3:30 bot didn't run, can you please assist?","supporting_doc":"","comments_history":"2/6/2025 - Restarted Bot at 8:42AM, will monitor for any issues, no issues, bot completed successfully.","status":"Closed","open_date":"2/6/2025 7:38:17","closed_date":"2/6/2025","bug_id":"","enh_id":"","subidea_id":"IDEA-21118","project_folder_id":"1G6-lIMXEenTn_KXSFH8Nhvz-3DS8p0MY","office_id":"OFF-024","sso":"OCFO","dept_code":"BG"},{"ID":"TIC-250201","project_id":"RPA-19014","submitter":"keriann.band@gsa.gov","category":"Starts, but fails in the process","description":"IGOV Bot fails at ASSIST file.
