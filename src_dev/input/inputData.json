When a real property disposal request is identified, it must be tracked in GSA’s financial system. Government regulations stipulate procedures on how the property should be disposed of.\n\nRediforce is a salesforce database that captures all property disposal cases. When they get a new project, they go in and create a new case in Rediforce. Rediforce generates an 8 digit code, this code used in Pegasys, HR Links and other systems that consume these project numbers. Nightly, Rediforce runs a report and sends an email with the case information to the code implementation team’s mailbox. The USDA Code Implementation team then creates a new code and property description in Pegasys on a daily basis.\nWe could also potentially speed up the process by running the report COB and getting the data entered the same day.","additional_benefits":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Derrick Tucker\"]","custodian_ids":"","npe":"NPE-0053","functional_category_id":"FUNC-026","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Mark Grgurich\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"1subDvPIhfV5bLZGOiH_CKR8-aEgJqn9k","office_id":"OFF-066","tools_ids":"[\"Google Workspace\",\"Google Chrome\"]","system_ids":"[\"Pegasys GUI\"]","document_ids":"","deployed_version":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"","created_by":"","controller_id":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","dd_link":"","rank":"","end_hypercare_date":"","legacy":"1","sso":"PBS","dept_code":"PZ","projectType":"RPA","milestoneInfo":{},"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"RPA-19075","subidea_id":"IDEA-19075","name":"FASAB Lease Standard Implementation (One Time Project)","status":"In Production","hours_saved":"32000","attended_unattended":"Attended","online_offline":"ONLINE","hours_added":"0","live_date":"9/26/2022","start_date":"11/1/2021","est_delivery_date":"9/23/2022","description":"Automation will take downloaded documentation from FY20_10 and process the documents through the ABBYY software","additional_benefits":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Deborah Sanders\"]","custodian_ids":"USER-0155","npe":"NPE-0002","functional_category_id":"FUNC-026","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Mark Grgurich\"]","project_support":"POA-009","project_folder_id":"1ekCJMLt4RCAkwOfUTtOoTdfZuoHCLjSn","office_id":"OFF-024","tools_ids":"[\"Google Workspace\",\"Google Chrome\",\"SQL\"]","system_ids":"[\"BI Framework API\"]","document_ids":"","deployed_version":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"","created_by":"","controller_id":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","dd_link":"","rank":"","end_hypercare_date":"","legacy":"1","sso":"OCFO","dept_code":"BG","projectType":"RPA","milestoneInfo":{},"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"RPA-19076","subidea_id":"IDEA-19076","name":"OAS Questionable Charges - Travel Card","status":"In Production","hours_saved":"1080","attended_unattended":"Attended","online_offline":"ONLINE","hours_added":"0","live_date":"5/27/2020","start_date":"4/2/2020","est_delivery_date":"5/8/2020","description":"On a monthly basis, OAS conducts an analysis on all active travel card accounts in order to identify card holders that have questionable charges.

The objective of price proposal analysis is to ensure that the final price is fair and reasonable when making a source selection. While this requires a high level of critical thinking and independent thought, there are several aspects of price proposal evaluation that are mundane and repetitive and that do not require specialized acquisition expertise.\n\nContractors submit price proposals in an excel file, typically in a price template provided in the solicitation. Upon receipt, the acquisition staff verifies that the price proposal file is not corrupt and all formulas are working properly without any mathematical errors. This often involves recreating the Contractor’s excel file into their own excel file, copying and pasting contract ceiling rates, discounted rates, percent discount, hours and overall proposed prices for all CLINs and subCLINs. Then the staff must analyze the price/cost information by comparing labor rates to the parent ordering vehicles and each other, comparing the level of effort (hours) and other direct costs to each other, and comparing all of these to the Independent Government Cost Estimate. Then this analysis is transferred into a narrative as part of the Award Summary document to justify the award.\n","additional_benefits":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Joshua Watkins\"]","custodian_ids":"","npe":"NPE-0078","functional_category_id":"FUNC-001","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Mark Grgurich\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"1Eki0-uoLc7eL9X5y6uHRjHXkOmmh24mz","office_id":"OFF-003","tools_ids":"[\"Google Workspace\",\"Google Chrome\"]","system_ids":"","document_ids":"","deployed_version":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"","created_by":"","controller_id":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","dd_link":"","rank":"","end_hypercare_date":"","legacy":"1","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QF","projectType":"RPA","milestoneInfo":{},"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"RPA-20064","subidea_id":"IDEA-20064","name":"PS Document Data Entry","status":"In Production","hours_saved":"2000","attended_unattended":"Unattended","online_offline":"ONLINE","hours_added":"0","live_date":"9/27/2022","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"9/20/2022","description":"Automate the data entry of PS Documents into Pegasys","additional_benefits":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Romina Russi\"]","custodian_ids":"USER-0174,USER-0178,USER-0002","npe":"","functional_category_id":"FUNC-018","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Salvador Talamo\"]","project_support":"POA-004","project_folder_id":"1wA3A1ZKT_YcA_waLjJTMCm-8Sd5gRViY","office_id":"OFF-026","tools_ids":"[\"Google Chrome\",\"Google Workspace\",\"MS Suite\",\"VB Script\"]","system_ids":"[\"Pegasys GUI\",\"Salesforce (PDE Tool) GUI\"]","document_ids":"","deployed_version":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"","created_by":"","controller_id":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","dd_link":"","rank":"","end_hypercare_date":"","legacy":"1","sso":"OCFO","dept_code":"BR","projectType":"RPA","milestoneInfo":{},"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"RPA-20065","subidea_id":"IDEA-20065","name":"UFCO Review Automation","status":"In Production","hours_saved":"7047","attended_unattended":"Unattended","online_offline":"ONLINE","hours_added":"0","live_date":"3/28/2022","start_date":"2/1/2021","est_delivery_date":"3/29/2022","description":"Automate UFCO Review Research & Submission","additional_benefits":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Alicia Saucedo de Flores\"]","custodian_ids":"USER-0002,USER-0165,USER-0178","npe":"","functional_category_id":"FUNC-022","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Mark Grgurich\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"1We4qKUInRMScWoGoSGsuYKBxkm9CwceG","office_id":"OFF-026","tools_ids":"[\"Google Workspace\",\"Google Chrome\"]","system_ids":"[\"RETA GUI\"]","document_ids":"","deployed_version":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"","created_by":"","controller_id":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","dd_link":"","rank":"","end_hypercare_date":"","legacy":"1","sso":"OCFO","dept_code":"BR","projectType":"RPA","milestoneInfo":{},"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"RPA-20066","subidea_id":"IDEA-20066","name":"SES Performance Rating/Review","status":"Cancelled","hours_saved":"600","attended_unattended":"Unattended","online_offline":"","hours_added":"0","live_date":"","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"","description":"Automate the aggregation and population of SES performance and evaluation forms during the SES review process once a job posting closes.","additional_benefits":"N/A","process_owner_ids":"[\"Christopher Wright\",\"Shonna James\"]","custodian_ids":"","npe":"","functional_category_id":"FUNC-030","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"1K2u1qmjbuVjvodjN7ZAcb9wa1tS02LVC","office_id":"OFF-076","tools_ids":"","system_ids":"","document_ids":"","deployed_version":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"","created_by":"","controller_id":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","dd_link":"","rank":"","end_hypercare_date":"","legacy":"1","sso":"OHRM","dept_code":"C0","projectType":"RPA","milestoneInfo":{},"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"RPA-20067","subidea_id":"IDEA-20067","name":"BGP: Lease Project and Tax Accrual Process","status":"In Production","hours_saved":"2739","attended_unattended":"Unattended","online_offline":"ONLINE","hours_added":"0","live_date":"11/10/2020","start_date":"7/28/2020","est_delivery_date":"11/10/2020","description":"Billing runs the 15th of month:  Process starts on 16th ends 3 days before end of month/ Data accuracy improvements of tax and project accrual recognition.\n\nMonthly process:  See Process Flowchart Step 1.

The first bill is a basic security bill based off of FPS’s workload averaged over the past 5 years, GSA pays 1/12 of this average each month. BGP organizes the data by building number/region and compares it to the list of current GSA buildings. If the building is still active Karen (BGP) will allocate the cost to the region and building.  Invalid buildings stay at the Central Office level. This is tracked on an excel file and used to populate a USDA template for mass uploading.  Errors may occur if building status has changed.  (Note: FAS and WCF may have an allocation as well)\n\nBuilding Specific IPAC- pays for customized security measures per building.  The IPAC can have errors.  It is on GSA to catch these errors and request credits from FPS.  One major discrepancy is vacant space.  PBS is responsible for paying building specific security on vacant space, however some space that is listed as vacant is not truly vacant.  The file comes from ROW but may contain phantom vacant space.  OCFO can find $4M or more of savings by scrubbing this data. The OCFO manually checks for phantom vacant space by checking for large variances in vacant space.  When errors are found we must request a credit from FPS and FPS would need to bill the correct agency.  BBP calls the region to validate vacant space, once the error is confirmed he creates a file requesting credits from FPS.  At some point FPS will agree and issue a credit IPAC at the Central Office level.\n","additional_benefits":"100% Review would save over 3,000hrs, Save at least $32K on system enhancements, Decrease

It takes the technician between 30 mins and up to 2 hours or more to do this routing.  The routing decisions are made on an order-by-order basis, by comparing the Item ID and CAGE code fields, and for some orders looking at different reference tables (such as sam.gov data, or other product-related sites), to determine the commodity type (tools, office supplies, cleaning supplies, others etc).  Once the commodity type is determined, the technician takes an action on the orders in OMS Call Center to assign a Report Office (M for Tools, F for cleaning supplies, N for office supplies) so that the order can be routed for action to the appropriate acquisition center's WIP.    Customers are the acquisition centers in each of these reports offices (N - R2, M - R6, F - R7).   Ultimately however, the end customer is of course the DoD customers ordering the items (Army, Navy etc); supplies needed are often mission-critical!    The timely processing of these orders supports one of GSS core mission objectives of supporting DoD supply needs.  \n\nThis bot is very similar to the HACMan bot, only simpler.   It goes into the same module (OMS Call Center) and it reads the same spreadsheet (WIP Analysis tool), so some of the code pieces from that may be reusable for this bot.    The time savings are legitimate - with an average of around 15 orders per day (or more, as the program continues to grow, which we have efforts underway with Navy & Army to do just that), and each order taking roughly 5 minutes to research, disposition, and route, rough est of initial savings would in the neighborhood of 340 hrs/year, initially.

It further checks for multiple same-type violations and emails notices when they exist. The automation then tracks responses and send reminders until the employee completes the certification.  The automation also processes and utilizes GSA and Uber Rosters which give it the capability to create Add and Remove Employee lists to be sent to Uber through SFTP (at a later date, currently manually). A Request Googgle Form allows employees to request an Uber account, that first sends to the supervisor for approval and when approval is granted, updates the Add List for manual or future SFTP upload.

There are APIs available to scrub for ride information every day.\n\nActual Description (ascertained during development): GSA RiLioTrav Program requires an automation that processes Daily Usage files from Uber (via SFTP at a later date), sends an email to the employee to use a Google Form to validate Official-Use, checks for, documents and emails violation notices for Tip Percent, Mileage, Start Distance and Unofficial Use. It further checks for multiple same-type violations and emails notices when they exist. The automation then tracks responses and send reminders until the employee completes the certification.  The automation also processes and utilizes GSA and Uber Rosters which give it the capability to create Add and Remove Employee lists to be sent to Uber through SFTP (at a later date, currently manually).

An email notification containing a link to the IOA Bot outputs (documents organized in a Google Drive folder). This modernization effort is similar to the Truman bot modernization effort, e.g. getting files off a shared network drive and into cloud drive and emailing the output folder to the requestor.\n2. Modify the variance report format output to be more reader friendly (landscape vs portrait format)\n3. Review the IOA bot outputs and potentially include summary level information about the output/\"\"as of date\"\"/hover over tooltips or embedded comments -- in order to educate the IOAs on what the outputs are/what they are used for/last updated source system data (specific requirements will be provided – delivery date TBD)\n\nNote: There is an IOA bot working group made up of interested members who meet monthly and have a high degree of interest in providing recommendations for enhancements to improve the IOA bot.\"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Kevin Mitchell\",\"Stacy Lowe\",\"Juliann Phelps\",\"Michelle Block\"]","npe_ids":"NPE-0040","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Deloitte\",\"Chantelle Lim\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"11-AILmj-pqZoqWi64THmEW_c9-KlbzH6","office_id":"OFF-005","comments_history":"[{\"date\":\"2025-02-28T20:28:14.783Z\",\"comment\":\"This fix was included in the project; ENH-25006\",\"user\":\"jonathan.smith@gsa.gov\"}]","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"2025-02-28T15:28:14.784-05:00","ticket_id":"TIC-250011","project_id":"RPA-20078","closed_date":"","status_date":"2025-02-28T20:28:14.783Z","status_reason":"","priority":"","created_by":"jonathan.smith@gsa.gov","created_date":"2024-11-19","rank":"","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QP","tools_ids":"","system_ids":"","projectType":"BUG","submitted_by":"juliann.phelps@gsa.gov","milestoneInfo":[],"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"BUG-25002","subidea_id":"IDEA-21008","name":"PQ: Pre-Award Automation 'Cody'","status":"Completed","dev_stage":"","live_date":"","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"","description":"Please increase the queue status to show the last 1000 runs or optimal threshold to allow for mass row tracking.","process_owner_ids":"[\"Joslann Feldpausch\"]","npe_ids":"NPE-0064","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Michael Griese\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"1uixW0TZ7g1qri3fQSuOUGcFVWwz3HYmZ","office_id":"OFF-060","comments_history":"submitted RITM1273200","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","ticket_id":"TIC-250121","project_id":"RPA-21099","closed_date":"2024-12-06","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","created_by":"michael.griese@gsa.gov","created_date":"2024-12-04","rank":"","sso":"PBS","dept_code":"PQ","tools_ids":"","system_ids":"","projectType":"BUG","submitted_by":"susan.dobrosavljevic@gsa.gov","milestoneInfo":[],"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"BUG-25003","subidea_id":"IDEA-23018","name":"Elements in OMS were not found during run","status":"Completed","dev_stage":"","live_date":"","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"","description":"Elements in OMS were not found and it is skipping over or failing for each modify order attributes.","process_owner_ids":"[\"Shanna Smith\"]","npe_ids":"NPE-0094","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Jonathan Smith\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"132d4VNGWYv99G4Ahq6xp6_lWRvXwAru4","office_id":"OFF-007","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"","ticket_id":"TIC-250123","project_id":"RPA-23018","closed_date":"","status_date":"","status_reason":"","priority":"","created_by":"jonathan.smith@gsa.gov","created_date":"2024-12-05","rank":"","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QS","tools_ids":"","system_ids":"","projectType":"BUG","submitted_by":"jonathan.smith@gsa.gov","milestoneInfo":[],"devProgress":"0","milestones":0},{"ID":"BUG-25004","subidea_id":"IDEA-21109","name":"Competitive Development Program (CDP)","status":"Completed","dev_stage":"","live_date":"","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"","description":"TIC-250125 - On December 4, 2024, Jan Baker completed/submitted the FY25 CDP applicant application, and Shannon Rudolph-Umthum did not receive an email notification.

Chantelle, Jae and RPA Team:  \nBelow are NCAL-Bot Enhancement #2-5.  As instructed, I will email an attachment with images describing this request.  Please contact me if you have any questions.\nThanks, Ola @ Supply Operations\n\n-----\nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #2:  Submitter POC Info added to the Justification Box\n-- SITUATION:: The NCAL-Bot transactions processed thru the NCAL eTool are assigned to the “NCAL BOT”.  In order to track who made the original request, the “Submitter” must manually add their POC Info into the Justification Box. (see image)\n-- REQUEST:: The Submitter info should be auto-populated into the bottom of the Justification box when the data is loaded into the NCAL eTool.\n \n \nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #3: Remove “PRICE” requirement for Shelf Life (SL) changes\n-- SITUATION::  When the Submitter sends a request for a Shelf Life (SL) update in the NCAL Bot Dashboard, a Price is REQUIRED.  This results in an error message in the NCAL eTool because the Price does not automatically change with a SHELF LIFE update. (see image)\n--REQUEST 3.A::  <<Page 1>> In the “Action” selection, separate / remove Shelf Life (SL) from the UI/QE.  Create a new “Action” selection that is just for Shelf Life (SL) only.\n--REQUEST 3.B.1::  <<Page 2>> Update “Current Selection” to read:: Characteristic Updates | Ch Mgmt (ZSG) | SL \n--REQUEST 3.B.2::  <<Page 2>> Include NSN, Commodity Center, Justification, and Shelf Life (SL) as a REQUIRED fields.  \n \n \n \nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #4:  Add additional columns  to the “Bulk” Price Update\n-- SITUATION:: Based on the current NCAL Bot design, the REVIEWER still has to submit a transaction for ACC and MOP data updates. (see image)\n-- REQUEST 4.A:: <<Page 1>> In the Instructions, update the CSV Template Example.  Add to Columns: ACC and MOP.  \n-- REQUEST 4.B:: <<Page 2>> Create a new “Change Type” selection for Price / PN / ACC / MOP only. Since “Bulk” Price Updates split into two transactions in the NCAL eTool,  ACC and MOP are loaded into the NCAL Bot with the PRICE update transaction. \n-- REQUEST 4.C:: <<Page 2>> Create a new “Change Type” selection for Price / ACC / MOP only. Since “Bulk” Price Updates split into two transactions in the NCAL eTool,  ACC and MOP are loaded into the NCAL Bot with the PRICE update transaction.\n \n \n \nNCAL-Bot Enhancement #5:  \n-- SITUATION:: Those with Administrator access can only assign Reviewers one-at-a-time.  There is a computer processing wait-time for each Reviewer assignment.  Yesterday, there were over 15 transactions all assigned to the same Reviewer.  (Yes, this is common based on workload alignments.)  The Administrator spent more time waiting than assigning.  “Multiple Reviewer Selection” would also improve efficiency with the Reviewer assignments of Bulk Price Updates. (see image)\n-- REQUEST 5:: <<NCAL Dashboard>> When the STATUS is “Awaiting Reviewer Selection”, Those with Administrator access wants to be able to assign multiple rows to the same Reviewer .\n \n\"","additional_benefits":"","milestone_id":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Ola Adamu\"]","custodian_ids":"","npe_ids":"NPE-0085","functional_category_id":"","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Chantelle Lim\"]","project_support":"POA-005","project_folder_id":"1fHpdmr0FkME6dNV80skwzqYTP0LO2rO8","office_id":"OFF-005","project_id":"RPA-24009","tools_ids":"","system_ids":"","dev_stage":"Hypercare","created_date":"2024-11-19","created_by":"jonathan.smith@gsa.gov","controller_id":"","status_date":"2025-02-28T21:02:43.143Z","status_reason":"Code updates","priority":"","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"2025-02-28T16:02:43.144-05:00","ticket_id":"TIC-240543","rank":"","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QP","projectType":"ENH","submitted_by":"ola.adamu@gsa.gov","milestoneInfo":{"kickoff_complete":"2024-01-01","archer":"2024-01-01","dd_complete":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11_B3QWSytQo1nUh-HxDtlpjl1xrok0xD/view?usp=drive_link","pta_complete":"2024-05-01","system_access_signatures":"2024-04-23","attributes_questionnaire":"2024-06-04","developer_testing_complete":"2024-05-27","demo_video":"2024-06-07","security_assessment":"2024-06-14","uat_complete":"2024-05-28"},"devProgress":"0","milestones":100},{"ID":"ENH-25002","subidea_id":"IDEA-20036","name":"streamline data extracts for EDW","status":"Under Evaluation","hours_saved":"","attended_unattended":"","online_offline":"OFFLINE","hours_added":"","live_date":"","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"","description":"Would like to discuss how to streamline response data extracts and work with the EDW (Gabe & Ernie) to convert the data to JSON files and only bring in new response data instead of replacing the file every night of all responses.

It will allow users to automate various tasks related to Requests for Information (RFI), data collection, and reporting, enhancing both speed and accuracy in project execution. In collaboration with AAS, the first phase of this project captured all AAS templates into MRAS, C-SCRM  requirements as well as other scope, and this will now automate the total process. This is an enhancement of the current process automation. \nSystems Requiring Permissions: Salesforce (for customer data and tracking); Qualtrics (for survey and data collection); Google Applications; Pipeline Reports (for tracking progress and performance metrics); eBuy\nOutput: Automated RFIs based on AAS needs; Market research reports in Google Sheets or Docs (spreadsheet & PDF formats); Consolidated data analysis for decision-making\nAnticipated Benefit: This automation will significantly reduce the manual workload involved in AAS market research processes, enabling faster turnaround times and improving data accuracy. It will also ensure better alignment with customer needs, leading to more effective project outcomes and helping AAS scale its operations more efficiently.\nFAS RPA Supporting Rationale: this one first as it's likely the lower cost/fastest implementation with a fairly high ROI with a clear path of implementation/adoption\nOCFO RPA Developer comments: This would be an enhancement on current project SCR-25004 with low level of effort. Estimated 80 hrs of development time.\nTIC-250141 - Submitting on behalf of QCCB\nSummary: This automation will enable clients to create their own Requests for Information (RFI) and generate reports effortlessly, using MRAS Qualtrics and Reporting Templates to streamline the typically manual RFI process. It allows clients to customize RFIs to meet their specific needs while simplifying data collection and reporting. Unlike the traditional MRAS service, this solution is fully self-service and involves limited GSA interactions. As a result, the outputs will be less comprehensive compared to the full-service offering. \nSystems Requiring Permissions: eBuy; Salesforce (for client data and communication); Google Applications; Qualtrics (if integrated for survey-style RFIs)\nOutput: Custom-built RFI for each client; Automated reports generated from RFI responses in PDF, Google Sheets or Docs\nAnticipated Benefit: This automation will significantly streamline the creation and management of RFIs, allowing clients to swiftly generate customized RFIs and access results in user-friendly reports. It will save considerable FTE hours, enhance client satisfaction, and promote more efficient data collection and decision-making for both FAS and its clients.\nFAS RPA Rationale: This one can be adapted from and expanded upon based on existing automations \nDeveloper Comments Need more info on requirements. This may be an enhancement to SRC-25004 if the changes are made to the Qualtrics survey. Estimating 40 - 100 dev hrs depending on how interactive the group wants the app to be. If most of the changes occur in Qualtrics then it will be closer to 40.","additional_benefits":"","milestone_id":"","process_owner_ids":"[\"Kristy Wilbur\"]","custodian_ids":"","npe_ids":"NPE-0048","functional_category_id":"","lead_assessor_ids":"","dev_id":"[\"Patrick Willers\"]","project_support":"","project_folder_id":"14TSa9wKwaqgcFmxFIkno-mPsRn51Khi2","office_id":"OFF-002","project_id":"SCR-25004","tools_ids":"","system_ids":"","dev_stage":"","created_date":"2024-12-17","created_by":"michael.griese@gsa.gov","controller_id":"","status_date":"2025-03-04T17:58:36.540Z","status_reason":"","priority":"High","comments_history":"","actions_history":"","last_modified_date":"2025-03-11T08:42:32.831-04:00","ticket_id":"TIC-250141","rank":"","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QC","projectType":"ENH","submitted_by":"juliann.phelps@gsa.gov","milestoneInfo":{"kickoff_complete":"2025-02-25"},"devProgress":"0","milestones":5},{"ID":"ENH-25012","subidea_id":"IDEA-20036","name":"FAS QC Market Research Tool (Applet)","status":"Denied","hours_saved":"","attended_unattended":"","online_offline":"OFFLINE","hours_added":"","live_date":"","start_date":"","est_delivery_date":"","description":"Cancelled and moved to ENH-25011\nTIC-250140 - Submitting on behalf of QCCB - Summary: This automation will streamline the AAS version of MRAS, known as Project APEX, enabling a more efficient process for gathering and analyzing market research data. It will allow users to automate various tasks related to Requests for Information (RFI), data collection, and reporting, enhancing both speed and accuracy in project execution. In collaboration with AAS, the first phase of this project captured all AAS templates into MRAS, C-SCRM  requirements as well as other scope, and this will now automate the total process. This is an enhancement of the current process automation. \nSystems Requiring Permissions: Salesforce (for customer data and tracking); Qualtrics (for survey and data collection); Google Applications; Pipeline Reports (for tracking progress and performance metrics); eBuy\nOutput: Automated RFIs based on AAS needs; Market research reports in Google Sheets or Docs (spreadsheet & PDF formats); Consolidated data analysis for decision-making\nAnticipated Benefit: This automation will significantly reduce the manual workload involved in AAS market research processes, enabling faster turnaround times and improving data accuracy. It will also ensure better alignment with customer needs, leading to more effective project outcomes and helping AAS scale its operations more efficiently.\nFAS RPA Supporting Rationale: this one first as it's likely the lower cost/fastest implementation with a fairly high ROI with a clear path of implementation/adoption\nOCFO RPA Developer comments: This would be an enhancement on current project SCR-25004 with low level of effort.

It is a legacy bot that was built in 2019 timeframe. Some of the issues are:\n1)\tThe bot requires many steps to run which makes it highly susceptible to errors when running\n2)\tThe bot is returning false positives requiring us to do manual scrubbing which is taking increasing amounts of time. \n3)\tThe bot sends google sheets containing questionable charges to supervisors requiring an explanation.  The bot is run again later to consolidate the explanations.  The issue is that if someone did not respond, we have to manually follow-up and keep track of this.  The bot does not provide any sort of tracker mechanism, nor does it provide any follow up email capability for those that did not respond.
