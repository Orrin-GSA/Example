The contractor inquired as to whether they could receive notifications beyond the initial one that is associated with the contractor employee getting their invitation to complete the investigation in eQIP.  It was conveyed that our contractors would be much better equipped to manage the security clearances of the many subcontractors, etc if they simply received a notification when it moved through the different phases (i.e., eQIP is complete, fingerprinting is complete, badging is complete, etc).  \n\nAs a next step, I spoke with OMA in R6 to see if the status (which is already available within GCIMS) could be automatically sent out on a regular basis (i.e. once per week) to notify contractors of the status of their many contractor employees.  I was informed that this is not possible with the system limitations of GCIMS but the COR can manually run a report and send it to the contractor.  \n\nIn this example there are more than 150 individuals seeking a clearance and, given the labor market, the vast majority are employees that are unlikely to have had any previous relationship/experience working on other job sites up until the day they need to be on our job site.  Hence the need for improved tracking and management of this process to allow for timely transition to federal projects from wherever the tradesmen/women are working prior.\n\nWould this be an opportunity to 1) work with OMA nationally to improve the system functionality, and if not, 2) consider the RPA team look at automation of a process which is manually completed by the CORs as of today?","meeting_scheduled":"Scheduled","outcome":"Referred out of POA","category":"[\"Optimize\",\"Automate\"]","benefits":"[\"Reduced process time\"]","assessor_email":"becky.schultz@gsa.gov","status":"Out of PO","thankyouEmail":"","pbsfasOutcomeDate":"","pbsfasOutcome":"","pbsfasComments":"","most_recent_meeting_id":"","meeting_ids":"","notes_id":"","legacy":"","office_id":"OFF-004","sso":"FAS","dept_code":"QM"},{"ID":"IDEA-23039","project_folder_id":"1YSi3XDf39oEWDD3kYGIGZEYU0kMbBEPW","submitter":"charlesb.johnson@gsa.gov","submitted_date":"10/19/2022 9:49:33","idea_name":"","description":"SLAT Succeeding Lease Bot - A bot that automatically fills out many of the documents required to complete a succeeding lease under the Simplified Lease Acquisition Threshold, including the SLAT Lease.

Section 5. Authorized uses. 31 U.S.C. 1344, as implemented in 41 CFR Part 102-5;\n\nc. Emergencies. Those circumstances that exist whenever there is an immediate, unforeseeable, temporary need to provide HTW transportation for those employees who are necessary to the uninterrupted performance of the agency’s mission essential functions (e.g., emergency management and/or continuity personnel responding after a natural disaster).\n\nCurrent process\n\nOption #1: When an emergency is anticipated, like a hurricane, OMA leadership notifies OMA HQ Policy to draft an HTW, which the GSA Administrator may pre-emptively issue.\n\nOption #2: When an unexpected emergency occurs, OMA Policy drafts an HTW and the GSA Administrator may issue an HTW.\n\nWhichever option is appropriate, the OMA Policy staff drafting the HTW must:\n1. Determine the following information:\n• Storm or emergency name• Date of anticipated impact/landfall• GSA region{s) affected• Names and titles of the deployed GSA staff\n\n2. Create a folder for the Emergency on the HTW Team Drive (Google Shared Drive)\n\n3. Use page A-1 in 5620.2 OAS Using Government Vehicles for Home-to-Work CHTW) Transportation) to draft an HTW and incorporate the information determined above.\n\n4. Save the Draft HTW Determination in the folder created in Step 2. \n\n5. Request OAS assign the HTW a determination control number.\n\n6. HTWs must then be processed through GSA's Controlled Document Tracker (CDT) to be signed by the GSA Administrator. To process the HTW through CDT, email the following to executive-secretariat@gsa.gov\n\nExec Sec creates a CDT record for the documents and assigns them to an Exec Sec staff member to process. Exec Sec then sends the signed documents to OAS and OGC for approval.  If OGG has questions or comments, they contact the OMA POC listed. Once the document is approved by OGC, incorporate the comments into the final version. Upload the finalized version into CDT for the Administrator to sign. OMA receives a copy of the signed pdf.\n\n7. Upon receipt of the final, signed HTW, save a copy to the Team Drive folder.\n\nNote: Processing a HTW outside of CDT (as of October 2017)\n\n• Due to the extreme time-sensitive nature of an emergency situation that requires an HTW, some HTWs may not need to go through the normal CDT process. This is at the discretion of GSA  senior leadership.\n\n• In this situation, share the document for comment/approval with OMA, OGC, and OAS.OGG must concur in writing (i.e. via email). Once concurrence is reached, save a copy of the email (or other documentation) to the Team Drive Folder.\n\n• Notify OAS of OGG concurrence. Provide OAS with a copy of the final HTW, a copy of the OGG concurrence email, and any OGG comments that may be outstanding.\n• OAS will work with Exec Sec to obtain the signature of the Administrator.\n• Once the Administrator has signed the HTW, save a PDF of the final signed document to the Team Drive Folder. Share with OGG and OAS.\n\nEXTENSIONS\n• An emergency may require GSA employees to continue working beyond the 15 day period of the initial HTW. In these cases, the GSA Administrator can authorize a 90 calendar day extension to the initial HTW.\n• Use page A-5 in 5620.2 OAS Using Government Vehicles for Home-to-Work (HTW) Transportation) to draft.\n• If additional extensions are required, complete a new extension for each period.","office":"OMA","addtl_info":"","meeting_scheduled":"Scheduled","outcome":"Referred out of POA","category":"[\"Eliminate\",\"Optimize\",\"Automate\",\"Facilitated Process Design\"]","benefits":"[\"Reduced process time\",\" Improved quality / Error proofing\"]","assessor_email":"becky.schultz@gsa.gov","status":"Out of PO","thankyouEmail":"","pbsfasOutcomeDate":"","pbsfasOutcome":"","pbsfasComments":"","most_recent_meeting_id":"","meeting_ids":"","notes_id":"","legacy":"","office_id":"OFF-068","sso":"OAS","dept_code":"H1"},{"ID":"IDEA-23075","project_folder_id":"1JFeMsOsq_H6iCNHUYIQfK0teJN9At4aG","submitter":"shanti.aranha@gsa.gov","submitted_date":"11/28/2022 10:57:46","idea_name":"","description":"Currently, Agency customers fill out a PDF form for Lodging needs and they send this form to our Contracted Lodging Vendor.

To date - we've focused on procurements above the SAT (over $250K). However, we receive repeated requests from existing and potential clients to handle their Under SAT MIPR funded product buys - most of which I've had to turn away leaving them with no alternative aside from waiting for 18+ months for their local contracting shop to take get around to starting their procurement. \n\nI recently took on a project directly from the GSS Assistant Commissioner, Erv Koehler, to find a solution for the USACE Washington Aqueduct Program responsible for the DC Area drinking water. They require a quick turn around of 2-3 days for 2-3 orders each week (under $50K each) in maintenance and repair parts to support their mission. This particular project will only generate about $3M in annual revenue, but if this project is successful, there is not only potential to roll it out to several other USACE locations but also to begin taking more Under SAT work for other client agencies. Just yesterday I had a call with Navy MEDLOG who informed me they are currently without any local contracting support and are wanting to know if my team can support all of their contracting needs to include several Under SAT requirements (roughly $10M annually). \n\nIn order to be able to successfully support federal client agencies with their Under SAT procurement needs while simultaneously doing so in a manner that allows us to continue to be self-funded, it is necessary for me to develop templates, tools and processes to leverage any efficiencies we can identify for these lower dollar product buys. I've already hired some developmental GS-09 1102s to handle  this lower dollar value work. Another possible area I've identified is the inputting of the same information across multiple acquisition documents. This information includes identification of the customer agency, a brief description of the products being purchased, the applicable NAICS Code and NAICS code description, SBA Size standard, PSC Code and PSC Code description, MAS Category & SIN Number and description for MAS delivery orders, RFQ Close Date, and more. Every key stroke equates to a cost to the Government and ultimately taxpayers. If we could develop a bot that would allow the CS/CO to input this data one time and it automatically populate multiple acquisition documents such as the Market Research Report, Acquisition Plan, Request for Quote and Award Decision documents - this would expedite our ability to process these lower dollar value more simplified product buys, improve quality by reducing human error, and enable FAS to accept substantially more volume of work on behalf of client agencies. \n\nThere are several benefits to GSA FAS being able to accept a higher volume of Under SAT assisted acquisitions. Not only does it fill a need that isn't being met for our clients, but also provides an opportunity to  hire more developmental 1102s and build on succession planning efforts. The repetition and faster cadence of these procurements will help newer 1102s to quickly learn GSA systems. I've also developed a business model to include an increased fee structure for Under SAT Procurements that has the potential to provide even more ROI and a larger NFI impact than our much larger multi-million dollar procurements. \n\nLastly - this project addresses all of FAS' North Star Goals to include adding tremendous value to our customers' missions, enabling and supporting a thriving, innovative, compliant, and resilient marketplace, and making it dead easy to do business with FAS. I'm very much looking forward to discussing this project with you in more detail.

Recently, we have had to access commodities that had modifications over 5-10 years ago, and there is no record of these changes. Records management for FALCON or NCAL is a tedious process that requires the employees to save the action as a PDF, and save it to the iDrive into their designated NSN folder. This process for one action alone can take up to 45 seconds to two minutes, sometimes even longer if there is no existing NSN folder. As of 10/01/2022, Global Supply has has over 1500 NCAL actions, and nearly 500 FALCON actions. That is 2000 records that are supposed to be saved into the iDrive, and could take minimum of 33 labor hours.

The checklist confirms that all of the required documents have been included in the contracting firm's offer. Region 5 modified this checklist several years ago to include information on each contracting firm. More specifically, R5 PBS added boxes to capture the small business classifications of every offeror that can be completed at the same time COs are checking offers for all other required documentation. This information includes if the business is a small business or not...And if so, is it a woman-owned small business, a HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, a Small Disadvantaged business, or a combination of each. This is an excellent way to capture contractors' small business information. However, this information is housed within contract files. It would be nice to be able to run a report to gather lots of small business information from within these files at once instead of one file at a time. We believe this would provide us valuable information for market research, outreach, advertising, location analytics, etc. Moreover, this information will provide us information on where we need to target training opportunities and/or industry outreach events, as well as quickly identify which geographic locations within a region(s) have a wealth, or dearth, of a particular small business classification (such as HUBZone firms)- which could inform how a procurement is set-aside or even sole-sourced. Finally, if this is implemented within the CODY-bot nationally, ity will enhance regions' ability to reach vendors inside other regions but yet still in close proximity to another region (ex.

Our team was able to come up with a simple solution based on Jae's guidance and suggestions which has been very helpful. \r\n\r\nThank you so much, Jae and Brian. We appreciate your help as always. \r\n\r\nHave a wonderful weekend!\r\n\r\n-Patty \n\nProject 1: FPDS to CPRM Obligated Sales Data validation\n**What is this: Periodically, we need to go into CPRM as well as FPDS and download data on Obligated sales. After we download this information via individual csv files, we manually paste information from the downloads into a spreadsheet and do calculations to see which figure we believe is the correct one, which is then manually entered again into a master Access file \n**Current state: Very manual process. Go into both systems and manually download sometimes up to 600 rows of data and then manually copy/paste calculations which then get fed into the master Access file \n**Desired future state: Have an automation periodically (maybe once every 2 weeks or once a month) download data from CPRM & FPDS, which will automatically feed into the data validation spreadsheet and run calculations. We will need to see if the RPA team would also be able to have data feed into the master Access file, but even if it cannot, having the automatic downloading of data and pasting into the spreadsheet will save a ton of time. Whoever is working on this project will need to sign an NDA as they will need to see some examples of data when setting up the initial automation and during project assessment meetings \n**When does this occur: This data validation is done every couple of months. Since Mods happen daily, often the figures between CPRM and FDPS are not in sync so this helps to try to find whichever figure is closest to \"the truth\". Having this run automatically and on a more regular basis (every 2 weeks?) will allow us to be more likely closer to the true figure at any given time. Since it'll be done via an automation, it'll put less stress on the data team\nWho does this: Jeff & Jodi, and Patty helped with the last one\n**Why will this help: Due to the sheer volume of data, it can take anywhere from 3-4 full business days to download and copy and paste information. In a similar project I had at TTS, I had to similarly download 100s of files of resume data and copy and paste into a spreadsheet. Having the RPA team create an automation changed the time it took to do this from 3-4 days to approximately 15-20 minutes, which will allow the data team to focus on other tasks \n\nProject 2: DPA Training data copy/paste \n**What is this: After every bi-weekly DPA training, Jeff manually pulls data from a report which is currently sent by Lorraine (I will be taking this over) and then cuts data from there and pastes it into various parts of another master spreadsheet\n**Current state: Manual process, have to make sure everything is formatted in a specific way and that specific data goes to specific tabs. The whole process takes several hours \n**Desired future state: See if the RPA team can run a script so that whenever a new DPA training report is created, an automation can pull information into the master spreadsheet\n**When does this occur: After every bi-weekly DPA training \n**Who does this: Was Jeff, but due to time and level of effort constraints he is passing this task over to me (Patty)\n**Why will this help: Having an automation will allow the task to complete in minutes rather than hours, which will free up my time to work on other tasks ","office":"FAS","addtl_info":"Since these are two different spreadsheets, this may have to be two different projects.

We were advised that since the rule impacts national security, OPC may be required to report FAS progress to the Commissioner’s office and, upon request, the OIG, Congress and media.\n\nWhile we explore manual approaches to accomplishing this workload by the deadline, we wanted to look at the potential for an RPA (or other automation technology) solution to tackle this workload.  The work is highly rules-based, and in my opinion, amenable to automation.   Initially I think the potential systems/softwares involved might include:  \n\nFSS19\nDocusign  \n\nDescribing it from a User Interface perspective, the basic process could look like:\n\nInitiate a modification in FSS19 for the applicable contract.\nGenerate a form SF-30 with standardized text to add the requisite clause(s) to the contract\nLoad the form to docusign and route to the contractor POC for signature (and potentially also the GSA Contracting Officer would need to sign)\nAdd the signed SF30 to FSS19\nClose/resolve the mod\n\nI suspect the automation could utilize an NPE or a custodian, but that could be determined with some further conversation.  \n\nAnd here is more background on the modification requirement from OPC:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r2Te-QioacLMfyj6jImE68Q00F5cXZeQ4vv0aRGSd94/edit#gid=1011595160\n\nShort term, this could solve a contract compliance challenge that has fairly high visibility. \n\nLong term, an automation like this could serve as a foundation for greater levels of compliance across our \"non-MAS\" portfolio of contracts, as wide-reaching directives such as these are periodically issued (for example the '889' compliance mod and the 'COVID-19' compliance mod directives from the recent past).    Emphasizing/indicating specifically the non-MAS contracts in my description here , as the MAS contracts already have some form of automation ('mass mod') in place for some time that handles actions like this. \n\nLastly, I have drafted a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the process now which may be helpful: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiG3stdCvmPtuWItLsppPbLhozszuPdU1iQM5ymvrBM/edit\n\n\n","office":"FAS","addtl_info":"I did receive some indication from OSI (?) group ( i believe located in the MAS PMO shop?) that there may be some kind of moratorium on RPAs that operate on any system that still relies on mainframe servers for housing its underlying data, which I believe is the case for FSS Online.

To do so, employees contact OCE to request a Qualtrics license. OCE requires employees to fill out a Qualtrics license request form. OCE approves, or rejects, their request and notifies them via email. Simultaneously (if approved), OCE must create the new employee account in Qualtrics and update a SmartSheet to reflect the new account (at this point in the process, the employee with the new account becomes known as a \"Qualtrics User\"). After the new Qualtrics user submits a survey approval request to OCE for review, via OCE's Survey Approval Request Form, OCE is notified of the new approval request via email, from a workflow created and sent by Qualtrics. Internally, OCE completes two reviews of the survey. We do this by populating a User Acceptance Test (UAT) log, where we capture our feedback in a Google sheet, and upon completion of both internal reviews, we share the UAT log with the user for revisions to their survey. *Note: A manual effort is needed from OCE, to transfer description data from the survey approval request form submission to the UAT log. Next, a series of emails go back and forth between OCE and the Qualtrics user until OCE reviews and approves the survey for distribution. Once the survey is OCE approved, in writing both on the UAT log and via email, this portion of GSA's/OCE's survey management process is complete. \n\nI am reaching out to all of you to in hopes to simplify and automate some of this work, and I look forward to discussing this with you, and if need be, clarifying this information for you, in the near future. *Note: Here is a link to OCE's \"Survey creation and approval process\" page on InSite: https://insite.gsa.gov/services-and-offices/staff-offices/office-of-customer-experience/programs/voice-of-the-customer/survey-creation-and-approval-process.","office":"OCE","addtl_info":"N/A","meeting_scheduled":"Scheduled","outcome":"","category":"[\"Eliminate\",\"Optimize\",\"Automate\"]","benefits":"[\"Reduced work\",\" Reduced process time\",\" Improved quality / Error proofing\",\" Customer Satisfaction\",\" Enterprise-wide standardization\",\" Innovative practices\"]","assessor_email":"brian.mooers@gsa.gov","status":"Out of PO","thankyouEmail":"","pbsfasOutcomeDate":"","pbsfasOutcome":"","pbsfasComments":"","most_recent_meeting_id":"","meeting_ids":"","notes_id":"","legacy":"","office_id":"OFF-068","sso":"OAS","dept_code":"H1"},{"ID":"IDEA-24087","project_folder_id":"1psbwMWER1og2xESecce9zE-eh0kYc_fk","submitter":"claudine.schleicher@gsa.gov","submitted_date":"9/9/2024 16:13:45","idea_name":"","description":"Monthly.

The agency does not allow GSA travel cards to be used for local travel, which is travel conducted within 50 miles of an employee’s duty station. The reason travel cards are not allowed for local travel is because local travel does not require a travel authorization so there is no efficient way to verify whether the charges were for GSA business or for personal use. In recent times, the desire and need to allow travel cards for local travel has risen from various stakeholders throughout the agency.\n\n1)        More employees are working remotely from home. When local travel occurs, they tend to use their own personal vehicle instead of a GOV which would require traveling to a location to pick one up.  When a personal vehicle is used, the traveler will incur expenses such as parking and tolls and need a form of payment to use.\n2)        The agency is expanding usage of Rideshare programs which can be used for both TDY and local travel.  Allowing travel card for only TDY causes confusion and misuse of the travel card for local travel.\n3)        The agency is growing the GSA fleet of electric vehicles. The Center for Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (CEVI) is looking into alternatives to pay for EV charging for a GOV, if the charging station is not WEX compatible (WEX is a payment card typically used for fleet cards). One of the options they are requesting is EV charges being paid with a travel card which carries the Mastercard/Visa brand and is accepted at charging stations.\\\n\nIf OAS can find an efficient way to perform their oversight duties, using RPA technology, to allow for travel cards to be used for local travel, then it would be beneficial to the whole agency.  This will allow OAS to help customers support their mission, reduce improper payments, and earn more rebates back to GSA for increased use of the travel card.\n","office":"OAS","addtl_info":"We would appreciate your help!","meeting_scheduled":"Scheduled","outcome":"Referred out of POA","category":"[\"Optimize\"]","benefits":"[\"Customer Satisfaction\",\" Innovative practices\"]","assessor_email":"william.spelker@gsa.gov","status":"Out of PO","thankyouEmail":"","pbsfasOutcomeDate":"","pbsfasOutcome":"","pbsfasComments":"","most_recent_meeting_id":"","meeting_ids":"","notes_id":"","legacy":"","office_id":"OFF-024","sso":"OCFO","dept_code":"BG"},{"ID":"IDEA-24091","project_folder_id":"10rNESbvUbY2xwGIOZMTv79BKoq2Gnv0Z","submitter":"christine.courter@gsa.gov","submitted_date":"9/25/2024 12:52:10","idea_name":"Hotel Lodging Tax Exemption","description":"When GSA travelers go on temporary duty (TDY) travel, they are required to use their GSA Smartpay travel card for payment of official travel expenses (i.e. lodging, rental car, etc.)  Using the GSA travel card for lodging entitles some travelers to have exempted or reduced lodging taxes being charged.  However, state tax exemptions provided to GSA cardholders vary by state, county and/or locality.  Currently, the traveler is responsible for checking the GSA website for information (i.e. forms, etc) related to tax exemption for the location they are traveling to.

FRAT automates the objective mathematical analyses performed during an evaluation of an offeror’s Financial Responsibility. During the financial evaluation stage of an offer/proposal review, Contracting Officers and Contract Specialist input key data from an offeror’s financial statements into the tool, the tool then performs multiple analyses and outputs a recommendation note to the CO/CS either in support, or opposition to a determination of financial responsibility. The CO/CS can then copy the output note form the tool and populate their justification documents.  The ability to perform this financial responsibility determination efficiently, usually within minutes, can be beneficial for analyzing large number of contractor financials quickly and uniformly. A MAS version of the tool is currently in use by some MAS AWF. A Non-MAS version is also in use by various GWACs. Although both versions are conducting similar analyses there are features that are different due to the differences in contract vehicle requirements. The goal is to optimize how the data is inputted into the tool, or how recommendation from the tool can auto populate various templates. The customers for this optimization will be MAS AWF and possibly GWAC COs/CSs using FRAT. ","office":"FAS","addtl_info":"This tool was developed by ITC's Innovation Division developer and in partnership with OSI there have been various pilots to gain feedback and buy-in from the MAS AWF, so we have pilot data on the use of FRAT by MAS AWF.

Final MAS version of the tool as well as official training will be released to the MAS workforce end of March, early April. ITC's innovation Division worked to provide FRAT to various GWACs, there will need to be an understanding on how FRAT is being used on the GWAC side.
